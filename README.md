The **'inventory.py'** programme will read data from the **'inventory.txt'** file and perform the following actions on it:
* read_shoes_data - This function will open the file inventory.txt and read the data from this file, then create a shoes object with this data and append this object into the shoes list. One line in this file represents data to create one object of shoes.
* capture_shoes - This function will allow a user to capture data about a shoe and use this data to create a shoe object and append this object inside the shoe list.
* view_all - This function will iterate over the shoes list and print the organise data in a table format by using Pythonâ€™s tabulate module.
* re_stock - This function will find the shoe object with the lowest quantity, which is the shoes that need to be re-stocked.
* seach_shoe - This function will search for a shoe from the list using the shoe code and return this object so that it will be printed.
* value_per_item - This function will calculate the total value for each item.
